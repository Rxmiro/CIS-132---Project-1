            Hello! My name is Ramiro Villagrana, and I am currently a full-time
            student at El Camino College. I am very excited for most of the
            courses that I am taking this semester, as apart from this CIS-132
            course, I am also taking CSC1, which is computer programming in C++.
            Unfortunately, with every right step towards a goal, many obstacles
            stand in the way, and for me right now, that is having to also take
            Math-180 this semester. Nonetheless, I have come to accept that
            whether I enjoy it or not, mathematics is a core subject that will
            be used throughout my educational journey; therefore, there is no
            work around it, and I must put in the work to take the steps towards
            my success. I look forward to seeing the outcome of things, as I
            believe that everything happens for a reason, and I can assure
            myself that everything will be worth it in the end.

            My favorite website as of now is <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/" target="_blank">Typing Club</a> as I realized learning how to properly type comes a long way.
